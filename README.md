# HaD-to-Py
HaD to Py takes the output file for a HEC-RAS simulation and creates plots which can quickly be viewed spatially for calibration or validation. The script and itâ€™s dependent files are free to the public. Everything was written by Lily Ann Tomkovic, a graduate student researcher at the University of California Davis, working at the Center for Watershed Sciences.
